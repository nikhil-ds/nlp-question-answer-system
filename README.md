A closed domain question answering system


This a NLP/Machine learning approach to a closed domain question answering system. The NLP solution is inspired by Dipanjan Sarkar's book "Text Analytics with Python". Also the question's are pre-processed and categorized using logistic regression before appying BM25 similarity measure to find the most suitable answer's to a question. I have tried to create a flask API in the 'server.py' file. The data i used has also been uploaded.
